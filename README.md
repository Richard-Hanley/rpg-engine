A rules engine for tabletop style rpg games

I'm still working out the rules for an rpg I'd like to use.  Evetually this repo will be used to help automate some rules evaluation during gameplay

What would a rules system for tabletop RPGs include

1) Managing action economy and determining initiave orders
2) Setting up skill trees, and mapping skills to playable actions
3) Generating probability distributions for an action based on action difficulty and skill trees\
4) A data model for creating custom actions

In general I'd like to create a RPG rules generator.  This would allow different gamemasters to create their own rules systems that fit thier playstyle and story goals
